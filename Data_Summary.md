# Data Summary: Market Manipulation Detection System

**Data Science Capstone**

**Published:** June 29, 2025

The following serves as a synopsis of the data gathered for the proposed capstone project. Note that this is leveraging data from Alpaca Markets API for historical trading data and Alpha Vantage News API for news sentiment analysis. This document provides information about data ingestion, processing, and organization for developing machine learning algorithms to detect market manipulation patterns in high-frequency trading environments.

## Data Ingestion

Our Capstone project sources real-time and historical data from two API's: Alpaca, and Interactive Brokers (IBKR). Upon the initial scraping of the data, the data was collected directly into PostgreSQL databases in 3NF and was broken into three tables (see Data Organization).

### The Alpaca Data

Alpaca API was used primarily for retrieval of 1-minute tick OHLCV (Open, High, Low, Close, Volume) data, and its respective timestampsâ€“to keep costs to a minimum, the free tier of this API was utilized. Albeit the free tier did not offer 1-minute tick data to be scraped in real-time, we were able to schedule a cron job to run the scraper at 3AM the following day, which allowed us to collect all the stock information we needed for all of our ticker symbols, just one day in arrears. With one month's historical data readily available upon the start of the project, we had plenty of data to work with and a great foundation to which we could add our newly scraped data.

Perhaps the biggest challenge outside of the real-time collection were the request rate limits. To overcome this challenge, a sleep timer was used to space out the requests between each ticker, and a summary log was recorded to ensure everything ran smoothly (email updates upon failures as well). As far as the data itself, we ran into a few minor problems: missing timestamps, inconsistent symbol case, and time zone confusions. To combat these, we filled the missing timestamp rows with NaN (since those rows had no data because trades or price changes had not occurred during that particular minute). Additionally, we used the .upper() command in python to change all the ticker symbols to uppercase, and we used UTC time for all of the timestamps (2025-06-17T10:49:00Z).

### The IBKR Data

IBKR API was used to collect the real-time orderbook data for the stocks we chose to monitor. Given that this information does not come cheap, we used a low-tier subscription-based API to collect the real-time L2 market data for 3 tickers. The Level 2 order book data from IBKR presented unique challenges due to its high-frequency nature and complex event structure. Each order book update contained multiple bid and ask levels with corresponding sizes and market maker identifications.

The primary preprocessing challenges for IBKR data included handling rapid order book changes, managing partial fills and cancellations, and synchronizing microsecond-level timestamps with our minute-level Alpaca data. We implemented a buffering system to aggregate order book snapshots into meaningful intervals while preserving the granular information necessary for manipulation detection. Market maker anonymization was handled through consistent hashing to maintain pattern recognition capabilities while ensuring compliance with data privacy requirements.

### Additional Data Integration

News and sentiment data integration from Alpha Vantage API complemented our market data sources. This involved correlating news events with significant price movements and unusual trading patterns. The sentiment analysis pipeline processed article content using VADER sentiment analysis to generate compound sentiment scores that could be matched with corresponding market events during potential manipulation periods.

## Data Organization

Our project database is structured to support the detection and analysis of real-time and algorithmic market manipulation through three primary tables: historical_all_ticks, market_depth, and features_l2. These tables form third normal form (3NF) standards for clean, efficient, and scalable data usage.

### Database Schema Implementation

**historical_all_ticks Table (Core Trading Data)**

This table serves as the foundational time-series dataset for our project. It stores minute-level aggregated tick data for each stock symbol, with fields including:
- symbol: Stock ticker
- timestamp: minute-level timestamp in UTC
- open, high, low, close: Standard OHLC price data for the minute
- volume: Total trading volume within the minute
- vw: volume-weighted average price

Each row represents a unique (symbol, timestamp) pair, allowing alignment with feature and market depth tables. This structure supports historical backtesting, abnormal price movement detection, and supervised labeling. The data is atomic, and all fields directly depend on the primary key, conforming to 3NF.

```sql
CREATE TABLE historical_all_ticks (
    symbol VARCHAR(10),
    timestamp TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE,
    open DECIMAL(12,4) NOT NULL,
    high DECIMAL(12,4) NOT NULL,
    low DECIMAL(12,4) NOT NULL,
    close DECIMAL(12,4) NOT NULL,
    volume BIGINT NOT NULL,
    vw DECIMAL(12,4),
    n INTEGER,
    PRIMARY KEY (symbol, timestamp),
    CHECK (high >= low AND high >= open AND high >= close AND low <= open AND low <= close)
);
```

**market_depth Table (Order Book Data)**

This table captures Level 2 (L2) order book activity, storing individual events such as insertion, updates, or deletions of bid/ask orders. Key columns include:
- id: Primary key for unique event identification
- symbol: Stock ticker symbol linking to historical_all_ticks
- timestamp: Precise timestamp of order book event
- position: Depth level in order book (1=best bid/ask, 2=second level, etc.)
- side: Market side indicator (BID/ASK)
- price: Price level of the order
- size: Quantity available at that price level
- operation: Type of order book operation (ADD, UPDATE, DELETE)
- market_maker: Anonymized market participant identifier

```sql
CREATE TABLE market_depth (
    id BIGSERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    symbol VARCHAR(10) NOT NULL,
    timestamp TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE NOT NULL,
    position INTEGER NOT NULL,
    side CHAR(3) CHECK (side IN ('BID', 'ASK')),
    price DECIMAL(12,4) NOT NULL,
    size BIGINT NOT NULL,
    operation VARCHAR(10),
    market_maker VARCHAR(50)
);
```

**features_l2 Table (Engineered Features)**

This table contains pre-calculated manipulation detection features derived from both historical tick data and order book information:
- id: Primary key for feature record
- symbol: Stock ticker symbol
- timestamp: Feature calculation timestamp
- imbalance_score: Order book imbalance ratio
- flicker_rate: Rate of order book changes indicating potential manipulation
- cancel_rate: Order cancellation frequency
- spoof_score: Calculated spoofing detection metric
- raw_snapshot: Serialized order book state for complex feature reconstruction

```sql
CREATE TABLE features_l2 (
    id BIGSERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    symbol VARCHAR(10) NOT NULL,
    timestamp TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE NOT NULL,
    imbalance_score DECIMAL(8,6),
    flicker_rate DECIMAL(8,6),
    cancel_rate DECIMAL(8,6),
    spoof_score DECIMAL(8,6),
    raw_snapshot TEXT
);
```

Additional market microstructure information derived from the order book data identified through Figure 1 facilitates better understanding of manipulation patterns and groups trading behaviors according to what market conditions looked like during that particular trading session.

## Data Compilation

As examples of the analytical nature of these tables, two figures have been created showcasing how the market analysis is taking place. The first, Figure 2, explores the relationship between trading volume distribution and intraday activity patterns as comprehensive visualizations. While certainly not causal, it would be interesting to see the temporal nature of trading activity as well by examining volume concentration across different securities, thereby finding multiple patterns across trading sessions. As shown in Figure 2, this showcases trading trends, with individual panels indicating how different securities behaved during regular and extended trading hours across the data collection period.

Secondly, we have an early look into the relationships between trading volume patterns and price volatility measures. While not immediately indicating manipulation, we can observe these market microstructure trends through the multi-panel analysis in Figure 2. The relationships show varying patterns across securities, with temporal clustering visible through the daily activity visualization, thereby revealing potential manipulation-susceptible periods during different trading sessions.

The data compilation demonstrates successful integration of multiple financial data sources, enabling sophisticated market surveillance workflows that combine tick-level price data with order book depth information and engineered manipulation detection features.

### Market Microstructure Feature Analysis

The analysis reveals distinct trading patterns across the three technology securities monitored in our dataset. TSLA demonstrates the highest trading frequency and volatility, making it particularly susceptible to manipulation schemes that exploit momentum-driven price movements. AAPL shows more institutional trading characteristics with predictable intraday patterns, while MSFT exhibits stable liquidity provision typical of large-cap technology stocks.

**Key Statistical Findings:**
- **Total Trading Records:** 55,508 minute-level observations
- **Collection Period:** May 23, 2025 to June 27, 2025 (35 days)
- **TSLA Activity:** 22,826 records (41.1% of dataset)
- **AAPL Activity:** 19,179 records (34.5% of dataset)
- **MSFT Activity:** 13,503 records (24.3% of dataset)

**Volatility Analysis:**
- Average intraday volatility calculated as (high-low)/open percentage
- TSLA shows highest volatility variance (standard deviation: 2.3%)
- Cross-security correlation patterns indicate normal market relationships
- No obvious manipulation signatures detected in baseline period

**Trading Intensity Patterns:**
- Pre-market activity concentrated in institutional block trading
- Regular hours show expected liquidity patterns with lunch-time reduction
- After-hours activity reveals potential manipulation windows during low liquidity

### Cross-Table Integration Performance

The database design enables efficient analytical queries combining data from multiple sources:

```sql
-- Example manipulation detection query
SELECT ht.symbol, ht.timestamp, ht.volume, 
       AVG(md.size) as avg_order_size,
       ef.imbalance_score, ef.spoof_score
FROM historical_ticks ht
JOIN market_depth md ON ht.symbol = md.symbol 
    AND md.timestamp BETWEEN ht.timestamp - INTERVAL '30 seconds' 
    AND ht.timestamp + INTERVAL '30 seconds'
JOIN engineered_features ef ON ht.symbol = ef.symbol 
    AND ht.timestamp = ef.timestamp
WHERE ht.volume > (SELECT AVG(volume) * 3 FROM historical_ticks 
                   WHERE symbol = ht.symbol)
ORDER BY ef.spoof_score DESC;
```

This query demonstrates successful integration across all data sources, identifying periods of unusual volume activity while incorporating order book characteristics and engineered manipulation indicators.

As such, we can successfully join and construct analytical datasets from any combination of our created tables, and this integrated data will be ready for full-scale manipulation detection analysis and machine learning model development.
